Simple library I wrote because I'm tired of writing it all
the time for each project where I need current time.

Feel free to use it.

## Installation

`composer require rikudou/clock`

## Usage

1. Typehint the `\Rikudou\Clock\ClockInterface` as your dependency in whatever DI you use
2. You can now easily test your time dependent functions
3. ???
4. Profit
